## :speech_balloon: Info

Hello, there! I'm a passionate Software Developer from Brazil.  
Lately, I've been working with microservices and RESTful APIs. What I'm most interested in is writing maintanable code that is easy on the brain and nice for the business. For that reason I'm challenging myself to practice TDD so I can stay in a state of flow while developing awesome solutions. Exploring stuff for fun and profit is what makes my brain tick. I have lots of fun playing around with Linux, DevOps, Functional Programming and everything in between.

ðŸš€ Let's figure it all out, shall we?
