## :speech_balloon: Info

Hello, there! I'm a passionate Software Developer from Brazil.  
I've been working with microservices and RESTful APIs with SpringBoot. What I'm most interested in is writing maintanable code that is easy on the brain and nice for the business. For that reason I'm challenging myself to practice TDD so I can stay in a state of flow while developing awesome solutions. Exploring stuff for fun and profit is what makes my brain tick. I have lots of fun playing around with DevOps, Domain Driven Design, Design Patterns, Functional Programming and everything in between.

ðŸš€ Let's explore the tech world together!
