## :speech_balloon: Info

I'm a creative backend software engineer interested in modern software practices and building great products. I'm passionate about functional domain driven design and domain specific languages. In this profile you can find a lot of experiments and side projects that explore specific concepts. It's almost like a public learning journal.

I'm actively developing [blocks](https://github.com/j0a0m4/blocks), a project that aims to provide examples and a small library to build fluent and type safe DSLs in Kotlin.
