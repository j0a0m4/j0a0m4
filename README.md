## :speech_balloon: Info

Hello, there! I'm a passionate Software Engineer from Brasil. Lately, I've been working with microservices written in Java and Kotlin. My main focus right now is improving my skills on Kotlin, Domain Driven Design & Event Driven Microservices. Although I'm mainly working with backend, I enjoy all parts of the process of building great software and look forward to further expand my knowledge.
